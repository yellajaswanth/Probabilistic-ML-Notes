# Probabilistic-ML-Notes

These are handwritten notes to improve my understanding on core Machine Learning topics. Notes are based on [Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction book by Kevin P. Murphy](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html). I chose this book since it has the most up-to-date topics I came across during my research and have very well-structured foundational knowledge.  

Notes covers most of the sections in the textbook and will have additional details or examples to improve clarity on few topics. 

If you happen to read the notes (thank you! ðŸ¤©) and have any feedback, please feel free to let me know.
